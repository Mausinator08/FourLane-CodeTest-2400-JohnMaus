# FourLane-CodeTest-2400-JohnMaus
My code test project for my technical interview with FourLane, Inc.

## Overview:
This program simply reads in `Data\Invoice.xml`, deserializes it into the `InvoiceQueryRs object`, and then reserializes that object to an Xml string, the Console displays it, and then it waits for any key to be pressed to terminate the program.

## Requirements:
- Windows, Linux, or MacOS
- Visual Studio 2019 to build the solution.
- .NET Core 3.1 or higher required.

## How to build the solution:
- Best way to build and run/debug the solution is to either select `Debug` or `Release` and then tap `F5` to build and debug/run the solution.
